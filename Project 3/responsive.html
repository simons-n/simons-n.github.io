            <br>
            <h1 class="page-heading">Background</h1>
            <p>My role in this project involved conducting guerrilla research with cat cafe
            employees and patrons, creating scenarios and storyboards, running speed-dating
            sessions, designing mid-fidelity prototypes, designing high-fidelity prototypes
            for mobile and desktop screens, and pitching our idea.  I shared these responsibilities
            with fellow students Amy Lu, Hailey Motooka, and Jee Rim.</p>
            <br>
 
            <h1 class="page-heading">The Problem Space: Pet Adoption</h1>
            <p>For this project, we were instructed to explore the domain of pet adoption, looking 
            for potential holes that could be best addressed through a responsive website.</p>
            <br>
 
            <h1 class="page-heading">Research</h1>
            <p>Our first step was to conduct background research in to identify an aspect of 
            pet adoption to focus upon.  We scoured websites for national and local pet adoption 
            businesses and related services. After collecting and reviewing our notes, we opted to 
            explore adoption through cat cafes in particular.</p>
            <p>Next, we went out into the field to conduct guerrilla research.  We spoke to cat
            cafe employees, as well as people who have adopted cats before.  We uncovered useful
            feedback. </p>
            <br>
 
            <img src="../Assets/images/persona.png" class="project-img" alt="persona">
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h1 class="page-heading">Persona Creation</h1>
            <p>Our next step was to develop personas for adopters, cat cafe employees, and
            animal shelter owners.  With these, we discovered the needs of each individual in
            the adoption process</p>
            <br>
 
            <h1 class="page-heading">Customer Journey Mapping</h1>
            <p>From these personas, we extrapolated journey maps in order to uncover the pain
            points that each individual might experience.</p>
            <p>The most important needs we found were that adopters desire finding cats that
            <b>match their personalities</b>, but this takes much <b>time and effort</b>.  Service
            providers and business owners want to <b>spread the word</b> about adoption to increase
            adoption rates.</p>
            <br>
 
            <img src="../Assets/images/storyboard.png" class="project-img" alt="storyboard">
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1 class="page-heading">Scenarios, Storyboards, and Speed-Dating</h1>
            <p>From here, we developed many, diverse ideas for solutions to the needs that we identified
            representing these solutions through 5-sentence scenarios.</p>
            <p>We voted on the five best scenarios, and set to work on creating storyboards, such
            as the one pictured above. </p>
            <p>Next, we presented our series of eight storyboards to several different users, seeking to
            validate the needs we identified.  In the end, we found one need and solution to pursue. </p>
            <br>
 
            <h1 class="page-heading">Results</h1>
            <p>Based on that storyboard, we created a wireframe using <b>Whimsical</b>, and submitted
            this wireframe to our professor for critique.</p>
            <p>Finally, we designed a high-fidelity prototype using Figma.  After receiving critique on
            this and iterating on it, we reached our final design: a responsive website that allows
            potential adopters (and others) to view cats at cafes and shelters through live stream videos
            hosted at those locations.  Furthermore, our proposed website will allow users to take
            personality quizzes to find their best matches among cats for adoption in their areas.</p>

            <h1 class="page-heading">Reflection</h1>
            <p>This project provided me with experience in very rapid research, considering that it was 
            completed in one month and in concert with four other courses. As a result, we needed to 
            collect and synthesize data as efficiently as possible. I was surprised to find how fun this
            actually was for me! Persona generation was an invaluable experience in this project, as well.
            Though I've found that personas are not always appropriate, they were useful in this project
            because our stakeholders clearly had quite different needs. </p>
