         <h1 class="page-heading">Goal: Promoting Social Connection Through Music</h1>
         <p>In this design project, my team and I researched and designed a mobile music application
          that helps users <b>see and interact with music and each other</b> in a more direct, engaging 
          way. We built upon social web theories and findings from our think alouds and literature 
          review to influence our designs.
         <br>
         <br>
         As the <b>Lead UX Researcher</b>, I set the research goals for the project, designed research 
         guides, conducted the majority of tests, and led synthesis. In addition, I served as the 
         primary <b>interaction designer</b>, creating interactive prototypes and animations in Figma.
         </p>
         <br>

         <h1 class="page-heading">Influences and Competitive Analysis</h1>
         <p>With the relatively open-ended assignment of <b>designing an interesting social app</b>, my 
         team was inspired to tackle the area of music listening by our perceived dearth of social 
         interaction in existing streaming platforms. While mainstream music platforms, like 
         Spotify, YouTube Music, and Soundcloud feature varying levels of social interaction, we 
         wanted to design an app that was “social web first.” Our most significant influence was 
         Netease Cloud Music, a Chinese music streaming service that facilitates user discussion 
         about music.
         </p>
         <br>

         <br>

         <h1 class="page-heading">Low-fidelity prototypes: Aligning on a direction and preliminary 
         feedback</h1>
         <p>Each member of the team designed low fidelity screens to represent ideas for our app’s 
         possible directions. Our ideas were aligned in that they all incorporated novel ways to 
         visualize social and musical relationships. We decided to move forward with a visual style 
         emulating node network diagrams, and we identified 4 screens that we felt were necessary 
         for the final product.
         <br>
         <br>
         My team and I then worked together to create digital low-fidelity screens, striving for 
         multiple possible versions of each screen. I created an interactive version of select 
         screens, and we presented our interactive prototype and other screens to our professors and 
         classmates. In doing so, we sought feedback on their preferred designs and their general 
         input on app-based social interaction regarding music. We took inspiration from this 
         feedback, noting potential features to include or exclude in our next set of designs. 
         <br>
         <br>
         At this point, I drafted an interview guide for user testing and ran a <b>pilot study</b> with 1 
         participant. Not only did this participant provide useful feedback that echoed some of our 
         classmates’, but this preliminary test helped me better organize my questions and 
         format for future tests.

         <br>

         <h1 class="page-heading">Leading Think Alouds with Mid-fi Prototypes: Narrowing our Focus</h1>
         <p>Using that feedback, my team and I created mid-fidelity prototypes. I then led the team 
         in conducting think aloud tests with millennial music fans, who we identified as our target 
         users. These think alouds were conducted using Zoom and Figma. 
         <br>
         <br>
         My first step was to link our mid-fidelity screens and make them interactive, so that users 
         could click through all screens during think aloud tests. Next, I created a user flow for 
         the think aloud sessions and wrote a series of questions that I felt we needed to answer in 
         each session. Of course, these tests were largely meant to <b>uncover potential usability 
         issues</b> at an early stage, since this was a design project. However, I also wanted to ask 
         users questions about the ways that they engage with one another regarding music, hoping to 
         identify angles that our app could uniquely address. 
         <br>
         <br>
         In this first round of think alouds, we tested with a total of 8 participants. Through 
         Google Docs and Zoom, I then led the team in synthesis. Besides feedback on aesthetics, we 
         found that navigation in our app was unintuitive, largely because of our attempts at unique 
         features. More interestingly, we found that every participant has shared music with friends 
         or family, but sharing methods are inconsistent both within and across users -- there’s no 
         universal way to share music.
         </p>

         </div>
         <br>

         <h1 class="page-heading">Leading Think Alouds with High-fi Prototypes: Usability Testing</h1>
         <p>After revising our designs based on results from mid-fidelity think alouds, my team and 
         I created high-fidelity designs in Figma, this time incorporating a visual design inspired 
         by solar systems, as we felt that this design would better capture hierarchy than the node 
         network design. I animated those designs to make them seamlessly interactive, both for 
         presentation purposes and to enable user testing. 
         <br>
         <br>
         With interactive designs ready, I once again created user testing guides and recruited 
         millennial music listeners. I then conducted all of the think aloud sessions with these 
         prototypes, with 8 users.  This time, I focused more heavily on usability than the previous 
         round, hoping to determine how well we had addressed issues raised in our mid-fidelity 
         prototypes as well as identify new usability issues.
         </p>
         <br>

         <h1 class="page-heading">Results</h1>
         <p>From the final round of think aloud tests, I uncovered a few areas of improvement for 
         the designs that could be implemented were my team and I to move forward with the app. 
         First, in an effort to design interesting visuals and interactions, it was apparent that 
         the team created some rather unintuitive features -- however, every user was able to learn 
         interactions after a short period of testing or minor hints, and remember those 
         interactions for the remainder of the test. Another interesting finding was that 4 
         participants, unprompted, expressed that their musical tastes do not “fit” well into 
         predefined genre categories. These insights promise an opportunity for interesting research
         in the future.
         <br>
         <br>
         The team’s final deliverables included a presentation on our research and designs, a 
         project report, and our <b>high-fidelity, interactive screen designs</b> in Figma.
         </p>
         <br>

         <h1 class="page-heading">Reflection</h1>
         <p>This project afforded me the greatest opportunity to lead research as I saw fit. I was 
         able to set a fair research plan and assign different research tasks to individual 
         teammates, and everyone adhered to that plan and those tasks. Because this was primarily a 
         design project, I was forced to squeeze research into a small window, meaning that I wasn’t 
         able to be as thorough as I would have liked. Even so, I am happy to say that my teammates 
         were more than willing to base design decisions on our research!
