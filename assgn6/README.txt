I also added the following files:

If you look at my submissions for Assignment 3, you'll see that I created low- and high-fidelity prototypes
for a cart page.  For this assignment, I created new prototypes that changed pretty drastically from my 
initial ones.  I added a white background to the cart listings to make them a little bit more readable.  I 
also included two "CONTINUE TO CHECKOUT" buttons to emulate Amazon's cart design, as we discussed in class,
but also so that users can see this option whether they are at the top or bottom of a page, assuming that 
the page will change size as more items are added to the cart.
